##### Company

Parse.ly partners with digital publishers to provide clear audience insights through an intuitive analytics platform. Thousands of writers, editors, site managers, and technologists use Parse.ly to understand what content draws in website visitors, and why. Using our powerful dashboards and APIs, customers build successful digital strategies that allow them to grow and engage a loyal audience.

##### Integration

Parse.ly partners with Optimizely to power Article Headline Testing within its content analytics platform.

Article Headline Testing gives editorial teams the power to evaluate headline variations and understand what resonates with an audience and increases traffic.  In addition to the default traffic goals, headline tests can leverage any audience segments, dimensions or custom goals already configured in Optimizely to ensure headline variations are optimized for your organization's goals.

By default, all Parse.ly headline tests have a custom page view goal which focuses experiments on answering “what variation increases traffic to the article?”.
